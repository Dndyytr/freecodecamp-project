        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Linus Torvalds' life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1969</strong> - Born in Helsinki, Finland</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1991</strong> - While studying computer science at the
            University of Helsinki, begins developing his own operating system
            kernel as a free alternative to MINIX, later naming it Linux.
            Announces it on a newsgroup with the now-famous post: "I'm doing a
            (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional
            like GNU)."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1992</strong> - Linux kernel version 0.12 is released under
            the GNU General Public License (GPL), transforming it into a
            collaborative open-source project that rapidly gains global
            developer support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1997</strong> - Marries Tove Torvalds, a former Finnish
            karate champion, with whom he has three daughters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - After a dispute over licensing with a
            commercial source control system, develops Git in just a few days to
            manage Linux kernel development. It becomes the world's most widely
            used version control system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008</strong> - Releases the first version of the Linux
            kernel 2.6.28, which includes major improvements in performance,
            power management, and device support, solidifying Linux's role in
            servers, supercomputers, and mobile devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - Receives the Millennium Technology Prize,
            one of the world's largest technology awards, for his creation of
            Linux, cited as enabling "a new era of open collaboration."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2012</strong> - Linux powers over 90% of the world’s
            supercomputers and the vast majority of web servers. Android, based
            on the Linux kernel, becomes the most popular mobile operating
            system globally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014</strong> - After years of using the Linux kernel for
            internal development, Tesla announces that its vehicles run on a
            customized version of Linux, highlighting its versatility beyond
            traditional computing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2018</strong> - Steps back temporarily from Linux kernel
            development to address his communication style, then returns with a
            new code of conduct for the open-source community emphasizing
            respect and professionalism.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2021</strong> - Moves from the Open Source Development Lab
            to work under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, continuing to
            oversee the development of the Linux kernel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Present</strong> - Continues to live in the United States
            with his family and remains the final authority on what code is
            merged into the mainline Linux kernel, maintaining a pivotal role in
            shaping modern computing.

            "One of the most important things in life is to have fun, and if
            you're not having fun, you're not doing it right. That's how I wrote
            Linux — because it was fun."
